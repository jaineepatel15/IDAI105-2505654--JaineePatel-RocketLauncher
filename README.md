# IDAI105-2505654--JaineePatel-RocketLauncher
An interactive app that simulates rocket launches using physics and mathematical models.

Overview:

Rocket Launcher is an interactive simulation application designed to demonstrate rocket motion using mathematical and physics-based models. The app visualises how changes in key parameters affect a rocket’s launch and trajectory, helping users understand the connection between mathematics, simulation, and AI-style modelling. It focuses on clarity, interactivity, and real-time visual feedback.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to apply mathematical concepts in a computational environment to simulate a real-world system. The app aims to strengthen understanding of motion, modelling, and parameter-based analysis while introducing foundational ideas used in AI simulations and data-driven systems.

Target Audience:
Students studying Mathematics for AI
Beginners interested in simulations and applied mathematics
Educators seeking simple visual tools for teaching motion and modelling

User Persona (User Problems):
Persona-
A student learning mathematical concepts related to AI who finds it challenging to visualise how equations translate into real-world behaviour.
User Problem-
Difficulty connecting mathematical formulas to physical motion
Lack of interactive tools to explore parameter changes
Learning simulations feels abstract without visual feedback
Limited understanding of how AI models simulate real systems

User Research Insights and Survey Summary:

User research and informal peer feedback indicated that students learn more effectively when mathematical concepts are presented visually and interactively. Most users preferred applications that allow real-time input changes with immediate visual results. These insights guided the development of Rocket Launcher, emphasising simplicity, clarity, and interactive simulation to support conceptual understanding.
