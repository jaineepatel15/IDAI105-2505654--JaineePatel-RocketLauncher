# IDAI105-2505654--JaineePatel-RocketLauncher
An interactive app that simulates rocket launches using physics and mathematical models.

Overview:

RocketLauncher is an interactive Streamlit-based web application designed to visualize, simulate, and analyse rocket launch paths using real-world mission data and mathematical models. The app combines physics concepts such as thrust, gravity, drag, and changing mass with data analytics and visualization techniques to provide meaningful insights into how rockets behave during launch.
By integrating simulation results with historical space mission data, RocketLauncher helps users explore relationships between payload weight, fuel consumption, mission cost, duration, and overall mission success. The dashboard presents this information through clear, interactive charts and filters, making complex aerospace data easier to understand and explore.

Objective:

The main objective of RocketLauncher is to apply mathematics for AI concepts—such as calculus, physics-based modelling, and data analysis—to a real-world aerospace problem. The app aims to:
Simulate rocket launch behaviour using thrust, gravity, drag, and changing mass
Analyse historical space mission data
Visualize relationships between payload, fuel, cost, duration, and mission success
Provide an intuitive and interactive learning tool using Streamlit

Target Audience:

AI, Data Science, and Engineering students
Learners studying applied mathematics and physics
Educators teaching data visualization and simulation concepts
Beginners exploring Streamlit and Python-based dashboards
Space and aerospace enthusiasts interested in mission analytics

User Persona (User Problems):
Persona-
A first-year Artificial Intelligence student working on a summative assessment involving data visualization and simulation.
User Problems-
Difficulty understanding how mathematical formulas translate into real rocket motion
Finds raw datasets overwhelming and hard to interpret
Lacks experience building interactive dashboards
Struggles to connect theory (calculus and physics) with practical applications
Needs a clear and structured app to demonstrate learning outcomes

RocketLauncher solves these problems by transforming equations and datasets into interactive visual stories that clearly show how rockets behave under different conditions.

User Research Insights and Survey Summary:

User research for RocketLauncher was informed by observing how students interact with mathematical simulations and data-heavy dashboards during coursework and practice sessions. Many learners showed confidence in writing formulas or code but struggled when asked to explain what the results actually meant in a real-world context. When working with rocket-related problems, students often treated equations as abstract requirements rather than tools that describe physical behaviour such as motion, acceleration, and force.
